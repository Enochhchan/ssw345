1. **LaTeX Configuration:**
   - Overleaf is configured with LaTeX for creating the Homework manual.
   - A PDF template is referenced from class, and **not** from external sources (such as the one at [GitHub LaTeXLinks](https://github.com/dariandm/LaTeXLinks)).

2. **Homework Manual:**
   - Created a new chapter titled **"Team"** which includes a short bio.
   - Added two `.EPS` figures generated using Visual Paradigm.
   - These `.EPS` files are saved in the image directory and referenced correctly in the document.

3. **Future Manuals:**
   - The current Homework manual will be expanded throughout the course.
   - There will be three documents: `Homework.pdf`, `Lab.pdf`, and `Project.pdf`.
   - Only the **Homework manual PDF** is required for submission in this first homework.

4. **Git Homework Chapter:**
   - Added a chapter titled **"Git Homework"** for the tasks from Part II and Part III.
   - All questions and tasks related to Git have been completed in this chapter.

5. **Image Conversion:**
   - All images have been converted to `.EPS` format.
   - If a method is found to combine `.EPS` and `.JPG` images in the same file, it will be documented and shared.
